# Lightweight Alpine VMs on MacOS

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/beringresearch/macpine)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/beringresearch/macpine)

Create and manage lightweight Alpine VMs on MacOS with:

* Seamless port forwarding

* Automatic file sharing

* Bridged networking

* aarch64 and x86_64 emulation

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to enable MacOS users to:

1. Easily spin up and manage lightweight Alpine Linux environments.
2. Use tiny VMs to take advantage of containerisation technologies, including [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/), [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) and Docker.
3. Build and test software on x86_64 and aarch64 systems.
