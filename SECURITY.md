# Security Policy

## Vulnerabilities

`macpine` is under active development, and does not yet have a stable feature set. As a result, security is currently considered secondary to
functionality, and it is not recommended that this project be used in security-critical use cases.

That said, if users find security issues in `macpine` or its particular use of its dependencies (rather than security issues in dependencies
themselves, which should be reported directly), they are encouraged to [create an issue](https://github.com/beringresearch/macpine/issues/new/choose)
reporting their finding(s). The maintainers will triage and address issues when convenient. Before creating an issue, please ensure to check if an
existing issue (open or closed) already addresses the concern.

Pull requests addressing any discovered vulnerabilities are welcome, with accompanying documentation of the issue and how it can be resolved. Please 
note that contributions to this repository are subject to the terms of the [license.](https://github.com/beringresearch/macpine/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
