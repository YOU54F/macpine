# Lightweight Alpine VMs on MacOS


## Motivation
The goal of this project is to enable MacOS users to:

1. Easily spin up and manage lightweight Linux environments.
2. Use tiny VMs to take advantage of containerisation technologies, including [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) and Docker.
3. Build and test software on x86_64 and arm64 systems.
