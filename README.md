# Lightweight Alpine VMs on a Mac


## Motivation
The goal of this project is to enable Mac users to:

1. Easily spin up and manage lightweight Linux environments.

2. Use tiny VMs to take advantage of containerisation technologies, including [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) and Docker.

3. Build and test software on x86_64 and arm64 systems.
